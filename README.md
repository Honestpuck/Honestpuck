ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve finished improvements to [PatchBot](https://github.com/Honestpuck/PatchBot), a system for zero-touch packaging and patch management for Jamf, my _magnum opus_ for 2020 and shipped v3. I am also contributing to [python-jamf](https://github.com/univ-of-utah-marriott-library-apple/python-jamf) a replacement for most of python-jss, if you think that's a good idea I'm happy to discuss my thoughts, drop me a note. I'm also working on a totally new project, scriptorium, a tool to make versioning and editing your Jamf Pro scripts easier that is currently in beta. I hope to release in time to turn it into a JNUC 2021 presentation, fingers crossed. If you'd like to be in the beta grab the repo and have at it.

<pre>
Puck <em>(to the audience)</em> :
If we shadows have offended,
Think but this, and all is mended:
That you have but slumbered here
While these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding but a dream,
Gentles, do not reprehend.
If you pardon, we will mend.
And, as I am an <b>honest Puck</b>âœ¨,
If we have unearned luck
Now to scape the serpent's tongue
We will make amends ere long,
Else the Puck a liar call.
So good night unto you all.
Give me your hands if we be friends,
And Robin shall restore amends.
