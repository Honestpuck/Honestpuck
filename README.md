### April 2025

I was retrenched from my last position so I am looking for a new one.

My CV is right here at [Tony Williams CV 2025](https://github.com/Honestpuck/Honestpuck/blob/master/Tony-Williams-CV-2025-02.pdf).

You can see me on Linked In [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/honestpuck/).

My blog is [here](https://macintoshguy.wordpress.com/)
.

ðŸ”­ My project [PatchBot](https://github.com/Honestpuck/PatchBot), a system for zero-touch packaging and patch management for Jamf, my _magnum opus_ for 2020 is no longer under active development. A total rewrite may emerge from testing.

I've also built [scriptorium](https://github.com/Honestpuck/scriptorium), a tool to make versioning and editing your Jamf Pro scripts easier. It was the subject of my JNUC2021 presentation. There is a rewrite of the system currently under way.

There is some work here on using the NIST tool set to enforce security benchmarks, (https://github.com/Honestpuck/NIST-macos-security-HOWTO) which was the subject of my presentation at JNUC 2022. Edits are ongoing.

If you like my work you can [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/honestpuck)

<pre>
Puck <em>(to the audience)</em> :
If we shadows have offended,
Think but this, and all is mended:
That you have but slumbered here
While these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding but a dream,
Gentles, do not reprehend.
If you pardon, we will mend.
And, as I am an <b>honest Puck</b>âœ¨,
If we have unearned luck
Now to scape the serpent's tongue
We will make amends ere long,
Else the Puck a liar call.
So good night unto you all.
Give me your hands if we be friends,
And Robin shall restore amends.
</pre>
