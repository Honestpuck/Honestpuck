ðŸ”­ My project [PatchBot](https://github.com/Honestpuck/PatchBot), a system for zero-touch packaging and patch management for Jamf, my _magnum opus_ for 2020 is no longer under active development. A total rewrite may emerge from testing.

I've also built [scriptorium](https://github.com/Honestpuck/scriptorium), a tool to make versioning and editing your Jamf Pro scripts easier. It was the subject of my JNUC2021 presentation. Work on adding extension atrributes is ongoing.

There is some work here on using the NIST tool set to enforce security benchmarks, (https://github.com/Honestpuck/NIST-macos-security-HOWTO) which was the subject of my presentation at JNUC 2022. Edits are ongoing.

<pre>
Puck <em>(to the audience)</em> :
If we shadows have offended,
Think but this, and all is mended:
That you have but slumbered here
While these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding but a dream,
Gentles, do not reprehend.
If you pardon, we will mend.
And, as I am an <b>honest Puck</b>âœ¨,
If we have unearned luck
Now to scape the serpent's tongue
We will make amends ere long,
Else the Puck a liar call.
So good night unto you all.
Give me your hands if we be friends,
And Robin shall restore amends.
</pre>
