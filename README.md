ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my [JNUC 2020](https://www.jamf.com/events/jamf-nation-user-conference/2020/) presentation and improvements to [PatchBot](https://github.com/Honestpuck/PatchBot), a system for zero-touch packaging and patch management for Jamf, and my _magnum opus_ for 2020.

<pre>
Puck <em>(to the audience)</em> :
If we shadows have offended,
Think but this, and all is mended:
That you have but slumbered here
While these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding but a dream,
Gentles, do not reprehend.
If you pardon, we will mend.
And, as I am an <b>honest Puck</b>âœ¨,
If we have unearned luck
Now to scape the serpent's tongue
We will make amends ere long,
Else the Puck a liar call.
So good night unto you all.
Give me your hands if we be friends,
And Robin shall restore amends.
</pre>
